   <h1>If—</h1> 
<h2>By: Rudyard Kipling - 1865-1936</h2>
<div class="#animated1">
<div class=Section>
    <a class="fun-hover" href="#">If you can keep your head when all about you
   <br>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;</a><br>
   <a class="fun-hover" href="#">If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
<br>But make allowance for their doubting too;</a><br>
<a class="fun-hover" href="#">If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
<br>Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
<br>Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating,
<br>And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;
   </a></div>

   
   <div class=Section>
    <a class="fun-hover2" href="#">If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
    <br>If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;</a><br>
    <a class="fun-hover2" href="#">If you can meet with triumph and disaster
    <br> And treat those two impostors just the same;</a><br>
    <a class="fun-hover2" href="#">If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    <br> Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
    <br>Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,
    <br> And stoop and build ’em up with wornout tools;
    </a></div>

    
    <div class=Section>
 <a class="fun-hover3" href="#">If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    <br>And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
    <br>And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    <br> And never breathe a word about your loss;</a><br>
    <a class="fun-hover3" href="#">If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    <br>To serve your turn long after they are gone,
    <br>And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    <br> Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on”;
   </a></div>

   <div class=Section>
   <a class="fun-hover4" href="#">If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
    <br>  Or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;</a><br>
    <a class="fun-hover4" href="#">If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;
    <br> If all men count with you, but none too much;</a><br>
    <a class="fun-hover4" href="#">If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    <br>With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run—
    <br> Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
    <br>And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</a></div>
